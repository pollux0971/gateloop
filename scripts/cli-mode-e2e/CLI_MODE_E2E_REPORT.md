# CLI-Mode E2E (STORY-034.5) — real Claude Code in the cage: SUCCEEDED (with one honest caveat)

**Date:** 2026-06-20 · run `cli_mode_claude_20260620_102446` · spent: subscription credits
(small — see Cost). `runGated` opened → ran → **auto-closed + read-back verified**;
`real_api_calls = false` after. Single variable: cli_mode · one CLI (Claude Code) · one
trivial story.

## Result in one line

Real Claude Code (2.1.179) ran **headless inside the proven Docker cage**, completed a trivial
story with a single `Write`, its diff passed the exit-gate write-set crux, and the gate
auto-closed — **with no host secret reachable** (Layer 2 proven on a real process). The one
caveat: the filtering proxy (Layer 1) was **bypassed** (Claude reached the API directly via the
bridge network), which is the accepted-risk half of the agreed two-layer model.

## Token injection (option 3) — token from ~/.claude, no new copy

The broker (`readClaudeOAuthToken`) reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` **in a child process**,
parses `claudeAiOauth.accessToken`, and the value flows broker → `process.env` →
`docker --env CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (passthrough by NAME, never in the argv). The token is
copied to **no new file**, the mode-600 original is untouched, the agent never logs the
plaintext (every printed line is token-redacted), and the cage never mounts the file.

## Layer-2 auto-gate (the backstop — VERIFIED before spawn)

A real busybox probe inside the EXACT cage config (cage-claude image + proxy network) proved,
zero-cost, immediately before the spawn:

| Invariant | Result |
|---|---|
| cage cannot read ANY host secret (fake `.env` + real `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.codex`, `gateloop/.env`) | ✅ HELD |
| writes confined, host tree untouched | ✅ HELD |
| injected token in cage env only, absent from sandbox disk, `HOME` not host | ✅ HELD |
| no `$HOME`/credential file baked into the image (only a non-secret onboarding `.claude.json`, content-checked for tokens) | ✅ HELD |

Gate held → spawn permitted (automatic; no human pause). Had any held=false, the run would have
aborted before spawning.

## Isolation review (the #1 observation) — real Claude, real bash, in the cage

From the observation stream (`claude-stream.jsonl`), every tool Claude actually invoked:

```
tool: Write -> {"file_path":"/work/slugify.mjs", ...}
result: File created successfully at: /work/slugify.mjs
```

**One `Write`, to `/work` only.** No `Bash`, no `Read` of any host path, no attempt to reach
`~/.claude`/`~/.ssh`/`.env`, no write outside `/work`. The real autonomous CLI stayed entirely
within the sandbox. Combined with the pre-spawn Layer-2 proof (it *could not* have read a host
secret even if it tried), isolation held in practice and by construction.

## Completion + exit gate

- Claude created `/work/slugify.mjs` (a correct pure-ESM slugify — lowercase, trim, collapse
  non-alphanumeric to `-`, strip edge hyphens).
- Diff vs the pre-delegation tree (authoritative): `slugify.mjs` only.
- **Exit gate (write-set crux): ACCEPTED** — `out_of_write_set = []`. An out-of-write-set change
  would have been `REJECTED_WHOLE` (the gate keys off the diff, not Claude's self-report). The
  fuller spec/validator/regression/Assessor stages live in `agent-delegate.runExitGate` (unit-
  tested); this first real run applies the security-critical write-set crux inline.

## Cost

`usage`: input 4 · cache_creation 6421 · cache_read 37961 · output 185 tokens · service_tier
standard · subscription. One model turn. Negligible spend.

## Gate

`runGated`: ran=true, **gate_closed_verified=true**, `real_api_calls` now **false** (read-back).

## ⚠️ Honest caveat — Layer 1 (proxy) was bypassed this run

`proxy.log` is **empty**: Claude reached `api.anthropic.com` **directly via the bridge network**,
not through the filtering forward-proxy. The cage had `--network bridge` (so it can reach the
host proxy) which *also* grants direct internet, and Claude's client did not route through
`HTTPS_PROXY`. So **Layer 1 did not constrain egress this run.**

This is the **accepted-risk** half of the agreed asymmetric model: Layer 1 is "set-and-use, not
re-proven"; **Layer 2 (cage has no secrets) is the backstop and held** (proven on a real
process). The worst case of an open egress is therefore bounded — the cage contains only the
`/work` sandbox copy (a harmless test story), no secrets — and indeed Claude produced only
`slugify.mjs`. To make Layer 1 actually enforce (a future hardening, not required by the agreed
model): put the cage on an **internal docker network with no gateway**, so the proxy is the only
reachable egress (direct internet removed), and re-prove single-host egress.

## Honest conclusion

- **CLI-mode minimal bridge: end-to-end PROVEN.** A real autonomous CLI with a real bash built a
  story inside the cage and its diff was gated.
- **Layer 2 (cage has no secrets) held — and was proven on a real process** both before the
  spawn and in Claude's actual behavior (Write to /work only). This is the security crux of
  034.5, and it is satisfied.
- **Layer 1 (proxy) was bypassed** (direct egress) — acceptable under the agreed model (Layer 2
  backstops; worst case is a harmless test file), but documented as the known limitation and the
  next hardening step (no-gateway internal network) if single-host egress must be enforced.

## Update (2026-06-20) — Layer 1 HARDENED + PROVEN

The Layer-1 caveat above is resolved. The cage now runs on a no-gateway
`docker network create --internal` network (no direct route out); a static Go CONNECT
proxy container (allowlist = `api.anthropic.com`, built offline) straddles the internal
net + bridge as the **only** egress. Proven by `prove-egress.ts` with a real busybox
probe — **4/4**: anthropic reachable via proxy, every other host denied (403), direct
bypass blocked (`--internal` no route), and the **proxy log is NOT empty** (it shows the
anthropic CONNECT — the exact contrast to this run's empty log). Wired into the live path
(`osCage.dockerNetwork` + `gated-claude-run`). Lesson recorded in the root `CLAUDE.md`
(容器 egress 隔離規則：設了≠生效，必驗). Open item for the next real run: confirm Claude
honors `HTTPS_PROXY` on the `--internal` net (this run showed it went direct; if it
ignores the proxy env it would be blocked with no route → a transparent/iptables redirect
would be needed). Both layers are now real, enforced boundaries.
